### Phage Research with Dr. Lauren Brooks
___


My research is focused on identifying and isolating Phages. Currently we are using *Salmonella* as our target species, with the ultimate goal to sequence and identify virulence factors present in isolated phages and propose a mechanism of infection.
<br><br>
Understanding phage infection mechanisms can help to develop synergistic phage-antibiotic treatment combos for severe antibiotic resistant bacterial infections. Catch up on modern phage therapy [here](https://academic.oup.com/emph/article/2018/1/60/4923328).
